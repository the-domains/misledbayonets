description: 'Myles was born with a profound hearing loss. As his hearing deteriorates, he searches for ways to bridge his passion for music with his Deaf identity. As founder of Portland-based non-profit, CymaSpace, Myles has developed technology that enables sound to be experienced through light and vibration.'
