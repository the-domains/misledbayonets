DEAFNESS + MUSIC = ?

Myles de Bastion a.k.a Misled Bayonets is a musician who also happens to be Deaf. His search for ways to bridge his passion for  music with his Deaf identity led him to develop technology that enables sound to be experienced as light and vibration. 

Myles is now using this technology to show how performing arts can be made more inclusive and engaging for the Deaf & Hard-of-Hearing.
