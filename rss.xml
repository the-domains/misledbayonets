            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Music</h1><p>Cherishing spontaneity & live performance recordings, many Misled Bayonets releases take the form of intimate & oft-improvised single-take sessions. Misled Bayonets adopts an unorthodox approach to song-writing by collaborating and recording in parallel with a rotating roster of local musicians and vocalists.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ff873f092903add1bfd138910c71afd6aae96142.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>DEAFNESS + MUSIC</h1><p>Myles de Bastion a.k.a Misled Bayonets is a musician who also happens to be Deaf. His  search for ways to bridge his passion for music with his Deaf identity led him to develop  technology that enables sound to be experienced as light and vibration. Myles is now using this technology to show how performing arts can be made more  inclusive and engaging for the Deaf & Hard-of-Hearing.
